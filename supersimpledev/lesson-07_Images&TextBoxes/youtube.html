LESSON 07: Images and Text Boxes
-> This is the start of the YouTube UI Project
-> This is where we can learn how to get a images from source by using inspect. 
-> img element is a void element
-> the src attribute is works the same as href attributes whereas they both locate a data by given value.
-> NEW ELEMENTS LEARNED:
    - input = an element that let you input and these are there attributes;
        * type = tells what type of input it is for example checkbox, button, search and many more.
        * placeholder = it will make a placeholder for that input.
