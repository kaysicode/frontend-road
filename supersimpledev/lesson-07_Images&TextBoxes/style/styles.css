/*
-> when changing the width of images, the heights will also follow to keep the same dimension (shapes) of an images
-> I also notice that, as long as there's only one size changer, one that's not present will follow the dimension to keep its safe 
(for example)
    - height is present then, width will follow
    - width is present then, height will follow
    - it will lost its shape if you change the both

--> object-fit = a property that's for the images and these are values;
    - cover = it will cover the area of given dimension (width & height) and it will still keep the shape
    - contain = it will adjust the images to contain all of the images although it will shrink in the given diemnsion.
-> object-position = a property that lets you to adjust what area you want to see in the given dimension
