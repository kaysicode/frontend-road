LESSON 01: HTML BASICS
-> This is a simple HTML document to demonstrate basic structure and elements.
-> This file also tell that HTML ignores whitespaces (extra spaces, tabs, and newlines) in the code.
-> It includes a paragraph, a button, and a link.
-> We created a button with the text "Hello" inside it.
-> We created 2 buttons, "Simon" and "Chocolate", with a break line in between.
-> We created a paragraph with the text "paragraph of text".
-> We created a link to YouTube that opens in a new tab using target="_blank".
